# Lesser DiSplay and KeYboard

An Arduino project to develop a general-purpose computer using 7-segment LED displays, a matrix keypad, and status LEDs. The computer can communicate with Kerbal Space Program using the kRPC serial-based interface. 

This project is (very obviously) inspired by the DSKY interface originally developed for the Apollo Guidance Computer back in the 1960s.
